# My Favorite Movie: Wonder Woman 🌟

Wonder Woman, starring Gal Gadot, is an incredible superhero film and a fantastic origin story. It tells the journey of Diana, an Amazonian princess raised on a sheltered island, who chooses to leave her home to fight a massive war in the outside world.

### Key Attributes of Diana Prince (Wonder Woman)

* **Strength:** She possesses immense physical strength and is a skilled warrior trained since childhood.
* **Compassion:** Her greatest power is her unwavering belief in love and her desire to protect humanity from evil.
* **Origin:** **Themyscira**, a hidden island paradise.
* **Setting:** World War I (a unique historical backdrop for a superhero film).

**Why I love it:**
The film focuses on her ethical journey as much as the action. She is not cynical; she is *pure* in her mission to save the world.

> "I will fight for those who cannot fight for themselves." - Diana Prince

The movie established a new standard for *female-led* superhero films in the DCEU.
